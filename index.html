											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<h3>Hello! I am Raghav.</h3>
										<p>I am an aspiring biomedical engineer, keen to pursue research as a career. I am passionate in creating and helping in the development of affordable products that will improve people's lives. I am curious, driven, creative, and ready to learn more about the field. I have knowledge in many lab techniques, data analysis, and am able to collaborate well in teams. I am quick to pick up new methods and topics, and am not afraid to communicate my worries or doubts. Outside of studying, I love to play basketball, lift weights, and pick up new hobbies (currently trying to solve the mirror cube).</p>

										<h2>Investigating the Effectiveness of Different Cough Solutions (International Baccalaureate)</h2>
										<h3>January 2020 - February 2020</h3>
										<embed src="pdfs/Extended Essay.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" />
										<p>For my Extended Essay project, I conducted experiments on different cough remedies to test which ones produced the most effective expectorant results. I made an aritfical mucus solution through independent research (though it wasn't fully accurate), and tested the viscosity of the solution mixed with the remedies. I analyzed the data's significance using single-factor ANOVA analysis. I also reviewed (through secondary data) the antitussive properties of each remedy. I worked with a supervisor, organizing regular meetings with them, and keeping them up-to-date with my experimentation throughout the process.</p>

										<h2>Testing Gibbs Free Energy in a Voltaic Cell with Different Electrolyte Concentration (International Baccalaureate)</h2>
										<h3>May 2019 - November 2019</h3>
										<embed src="pdfs/Chemistry IA Final Draft.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" />
										<p>For my chemistry Internal Assessment, I conducted experiments on the Copper-Zinc voltaic cell (Daniell cell). I tested how the electrolyte concentrations in the cell affected the voltage, and thus the gibbs free energy (through the Nernst equation). I used many laboratory tools, such as  a Burette, pipette, micropipette, volumetric flask, and electronic mass balance to precisely create a stock solution, and differing concentrations of electrolyte solutions. I also learned how to calculate the percentage uncerntainties of my measurements, and create risk assessments of the chemicals I was using.

										<h2>Examining how the Salinity of the Avicennia leaves are affected by distance from the ground (International Baccalaureate)</h2>
										<h3>March 2019 - May 2019</h3>
										<embed src="pdfs/Biology IA- Avicennia salinity compared to height.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" />
										<p>For my biology Internal Assessment, I travelled to Sedili Besar, Malaysia, and tested on the Avicennia leaves in the mangroves. Avicennia leaves excrete excess salt from their leaf surfaces, and only have a partial exclusion of salt from the roots. I tested how the height of the leaf affected its salinity content. I learnt how to use a conductivity probe, and present my findings in excel and word. Additionally, during the trip, I learned a lot about the importance of the conservation of the rainforests and mangroves, and how palm oil plantations affected this.</p>
