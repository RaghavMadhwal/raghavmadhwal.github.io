										<h2>Designing a New Generation Implant for Distal Femur Fractures (BMEG 230)</h2>
										<h3>September 2021 - December 2021</h3>

										<h2>Investigating the Effectiveness of Different Cough Solutions (International Baccalaureate)</h2>
										<h3>January 2020 - February 2020</h3>
										<ul><h3><a href="pdfs/Extended Essay.pdf" target="blank" class="icon style2 fa-copy"> Extended Essay Report</a></h3></ul>
										<p>For my Extended Essay project, I conducted experiments on different cough remedies to test which ones produced the most effective expectorant results. I made an aritfical mucus solution through independent research (though it wasn't fully accurate), and tested the viscosity of the solution mixed with the remedies. I analyzed the data's significance using single-factor ANOVA analysis. I also reviewed (through secondary data) the antitussive properties of each remedy. I worked with a supervisor, organizing regular meetings with them, and keeping them up-to-date with my experimentation throughout the process.</p>

										<h2>Examining how the Salinity of the Avicennia leaves are affected by distance from the ground (International Baccalaureate)</h2>
										<h3>March 2019 - May 2019</h3>
										<ul><h3><a href="pdfs/Biology IA- Avicennia salinity compared to height.pdf" target="blank" class="icon style2 fa-copy"> Internal Assessment Report</a></h3></ul>
										<p>For my biology Internal Assessment, I travelled to Sedili Besar, Malaysia, and tested on the Avicennia leaves in the mangroves. Avicennia leaves excrete excess salt from their leaf surfaces, and only have a partial exclusion of salt from the roots. I tested how the height of the leaf affected its salinity content. I learnt how to use a conductivity probe, and present my findings in excel and word. Additionally, during the trip, I learned a lot about the importance of the conservation of the rainforests and mangroves, and how palm oil plantations affected this.</p>

										<h2>Testing Gibbs Free Energy in a Voltaic Cell with Different Electrolyte Concentration (International Baccalaureate)</h2>
										<h3>May 2019 - November 2019</h3>
										<ul><h3><a href="pdfs/Chemistry IA Final Draft.pdf" target="blank" class="icon style2 fa-copy"> Internal Assessment Report</a></h3></ul>
										<p>For my chemistry Internal Assessment, I conducted experiments on the Copper-Zinc voltaic cell (Daniell cell). I tested how the electrolyte concentrations in the cell affected the voltage, and thus the gibbs free energy (through the Nernst equation). I used many laboratory tools, such as  a Burette, pipette, micropipette, volumetric flask, and electronic mass balance to precisely create a stock solution, and differing concentrations of electrolyte solutions. I also learned how to calculate the percentage uncerntainties of my measurements, and create risk assessments of the chemicals I was using.

										<p><a href="AIIMS.html" target="blank" class="button"><strong>All India Institute of Medical Sciences</strong> Shadow Under PhD students</a></p>
										<p>I had the opportunity to shadow under the PhD students in the gastroeneterology and pharmacology departments at AIIMS, and learn about multiple concepts, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), animal testing, cell culture lines and nano formulation. I also had the opportunity to operate the centrifuge and conduct electrophoresis, using the blotting tank to aid in the testing of different protein molecules.</p>
